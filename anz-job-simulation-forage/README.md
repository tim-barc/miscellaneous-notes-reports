### ANZ Cyber Security Management â€“ Forage Job Simulation

This repository contains all deliverables and outputs from the **ANZ Cyber Security Management** virtual job simulation, hosted on **The Forage**. This program offers a highly practical introduction to real-world cybersecurity analysis, with a strong emphasis on email threat detection and packet capture investigation.

### What You'll Find in This Repository

The simulation is broken down into two major tasks that reflect real responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals in a corporate environment.

---

## ðŸ“¨ Task 1 â€“ Email Threat Analysis

**Objective:** Analyse various emails to determine whether they are safe or malicious, justifying your decisions based on observable indicators.

**Skills Gained:**

* Identifying phishing and social engineering techniques
* Recognising malicious sender patterns, homograph attacks, defanged URLs, spoofed domains
* Building rationale for email triage decisions using threat intelligence heuristics

**Outcome:** Improved email analysis and phishing detection capabilities in a realistic corporate setting.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Task 2 â€“ Packet Capture (PCAP) Analysis

**Objective:** Perform forensic analysis on packet captures to uncover embedded malicious content and hidden files.

**Skills Gained:**

* HTTP object carving and manual hex reconstruction
* Identifying suspicious file types in transit
* Detecting hidden or disguised files (e.g., ZIPs disguised as PDFs, embedded images, base64 encoding)

**Outcome:** Developed technical analysis skills using tools like Wireshark and HxD to manually extract and assess files in network traffic.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

Compared to other simulations, this job experience provided a more forensic-focused lens into cyber operations. It sharpened both high-level analytical thinking (email triage) and deep technical skills (PCAP carving), mimicking the demands of working in a security operations centre or DFIR team.
