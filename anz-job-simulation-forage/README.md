### ANZ Cyber Security Management – Forage Job Simulation

This repository contains all deliverables and outputs from the **ANZ Cyber Security Management** virtual job simulation, hosted on **The Forage**. This program offers a highly practical introduction to real-world cybersecurity analysis, with a strong emphasis on email analysis and network forensics. 

### What You'll Find in This Repository

The simulation is broken down into two major tasks. 


## Task 1 – Email Threat Analysis

**Objective:** Analyse various emails to determine whether they are safe or malicious, justifying your decisions based on observable indicators.

**Skills Gained:**

* Identifying phishing and social engineering techniques
* Recognising malicious sender patterns, homograph attacks
